      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to String Fling @ Home! Get ready for a fun weekend of
        string-centered playing workshops, games, presentations, escape rooms,
        and more. Curious about Mariachi? Fiddling? Love movie music? Ever
        wondered how string instruments are made? Maybe want to try your hand at
        composing music? Want to improve your fast playing, or vibrato? We’ve
        got it all! <br /><br />
        Due to Covid, we’ve had to re-invent our annual String Fling—for the
        first time in 48 years, we won’t be able to meet together for in-person
        orchestras. Nevertheless, we’re going to have a great time learning
        about music and string playing in this online format. Read on to learn
        how it will work, and what the activities will be

          String students grades 4th - 9th who participate in their school orchestras or 
          home school programs are invited to attend!

      <h2>How Will String Fling Work Online?</h2>
      <div class="text-section">
      <p>
        Because of the online format this year, we have dropped the registration fee to $15 
        per student for those early birds who register between Nov. 16-Dec. 31, 2020. 
        It will go up to $20 per student for registration between Jan. 1-25, 2021.
        <br><br>
        <b>Step #1:</b> Register your students/children by following the link given below. 
        <ul style="padding-left: 5rem;">
          <li>This will take you to the old String Fling website, where you will follow the
             directions to register through Cognito Forms as in past years. You can pay 
             directly in Cognito Forms with a credit card or Paypal, or send a check.</li>
          <li> We will have three tracks for students this year, based on age and playing 
            experience: First and Second year players (5th-6th grade), 7th Grade, and 
            8th/9th grade. Class material will be geared towards expected playing 
            ability and social maturity.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>      
        <br><br>
      <p>
        <b>Step #2:</b> The email provided in the registration will be the one where Zoom links 
        for the classes available to each track are sent.
        <ul style="padding-left: 5rem;">
          <li> If you are a teacher registering multiple students, please make sure to 
            provide the correct links to your students based on their track.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
        <br><br>
      <p>
        <b>Step #3:</b> Zoom links will be sent out a week before the event, by Jan. 26, 2021 at 
        the latest. They will be sent only to the email provided on the registration form. 
        <ul style="padding-left: 5rem;">
          <li> Each String Fling @ Home event will have a unique link. There will be K-State
             string students helping to monitor the Zoom sessions throughout. </li>
          <li> Please send your students the appropriate Zoom links for each track. </li>
          <li> Students will be randomly sorted into “Houses” and will win (or lose) points
             for their house during the sessions. This information will be sent along 
             with the Zoom links, to the email provided in the registration. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
        <br><br>
      <p>
        <b>Step #4:</b> Prepare to have fun!
        <ul style="padding-left: 5rem;">
          <li> The event will run between 10:00 a.m.- noon and 1:00 p.m.-3:00 p.m. each day,
             with a noon lunch hour. Students will be able to participate in eight different
              sessions over the two days!</li>
          <li> Each session will last 30-40 minutes within the hour, leaving time for a 
            break, or to get ready for the next one, or perhaps ask the teacher questions 
            on the material.</li>
          <li> During some hours, students will have a choice of activities. They should 
            use the schedule to decide which one to choose!</li>
          <li> There may also be pdf’s of music for some sessions that students could work
             on ahead of time. The pdf’s will be posted on this website, or e-mailed to 
             teachers by request.</li>
          <li>We will all come together Sunday at 2:00 for a Grand Finale with surprises 
            and the announcement of the House Cup winner!</li>
        </ul>
