      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to String Fling @ Home! Get ready for a fun weekend of
        string-centered playing workshops, games, presentations, escape rooms,
        and more. Curious about Mariachi? Fiddling? Love movie music? Ever
        wondered how string instruments are made? Maybe want to try your hand at
        composing music? Want to improve your fast playing, or vibrato? We’ve
        got it all! <br /><br />
        Due to Covid, we’ve had to re-invent our annual String Fling—for the
        first time in 48 years, we won’t be able to meet together for in-person
        orchestras. Nevertheless, we’re going to have a great time learning
        about music and string playing in this online format. Read on to learn
        how it will work, and what the activities will be.
      </p>

        <h2>Join The Fun!</h2>
        <p>
          String students grades 4th - 9th who participate in their school
          orchestras or home school programs are invited to attend!

      <h2>How Will String Fling Work Online?</h2>
      <div class="text-section">
        <p>
          Because of the online format this year, we have dropped the
          registration fee to $15 per student for those early birds who register
          between Nov. 16-Dec. 31, 2020. It will go up to $20 per student for
          registration between Jan. 1-25, 2021.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Step #1:</b> Register your students/children by following the
          directions listed in the "registration page".
        </p>
        <ul style="padding-left: 5rem">
          <li>
            Click the "Register" link above, where you will follow the
            directions to register through Cognito Forms as in past years. You
            can pay directly in Cognito Forms with a credit card or Paypal, or
            send a check.
          </li>
          <li>
            We will have three tracks for students this year, based on age and
            playing experience: First and Second year players (4th-6th grade),
            7th Grade, and 8th/9th grade. Class material will be geared towards
            expected playing ability and social maturity.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          <b>Step #2:</b> The email provided in the registration will be the one
          where Zoom links for the classes available to each track are sent.
        </p>
        <ul style="padding-left: 5rem">
          <li>
            If you are a teacher registering multiple students, please make sure
            to provide the correct links to your students based on their track.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br /><br />
        <p>
          <b>Step #3:</b> Zoom links will be sent out a week before the event,
          by Jan. 26, 2021 at the latest. They will be sent only to the email
          provided on the registration form.
        </p>

        <ul style="padding-left: 5rem">
          <li>
            Each String Fling @ Home event will have a unique link. There will
            be K-State string students helping to monitor the Zoom sessions
            throughout.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please send your students the appropriate Zoom links for each track.
          </li>
          <li>
            Students will be randomly sorted into “Houses” and will win (or
            lose) points for their house during the sessions. This information
            will be sent along with the Zoom links, to the email provided in the
            registration.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br /><br />
        <p><b>Step #4:</b> Prepare to have fun!</p>

        <ul style="padding-left: 5rem">
          <li>
            The event will run between 10:00 a.m.- noon and 1:00 p.m.-3:00 p.m.
            each day, with a noon lunch hour. Students will be able to
            participate in eight different sessions over the two days!
          </li>
          <li>
            Each session will last 30-40 minutes within the hour, leaving time
            for a break, or to get ready for the next one, or perhaps ask the
            teacher questions on the material.
          </li>
          <li>
            During some hours, students will have a choice of activities. They
            should use the schedule to decide which one to choose!
          </li>
          <li>
            There may also be pdf’s of music for some sessions that students
            could work on ahead of time. The pdf’s will be posted on this
            website, or e-mailed to teachers by request.
          </li>
          <li>
            We will all come together Sunday at 2:00 for a Grand Finale with
            surprises and the announcement of the House Cup winner!
